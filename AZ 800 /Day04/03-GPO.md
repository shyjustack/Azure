# GPO inheritance

GPO inheritance means that a Group Policy applied at a higher level (like a domain or parent OU) is automatically passed down and applied to lower levels (like child OUs or users/computers inside it).
# Block Inheritance
You can configure a domain or OU to prevent the inheritance of policy settings. This is known as blocking inheritance. To block inheritance, right-click or access the context menu for the domain or OU in the GPMC console tree, and then select Block Inheritance.
