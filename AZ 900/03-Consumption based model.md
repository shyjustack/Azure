### Consumption based model
Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for
the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.

This consumption-based model brings with it many benefits, including:

● No upfront costs

● No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that they may or may not use to its fullest

● The ability to pay for additional resources if and when they are needed

● The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
