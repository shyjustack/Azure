### Public Cloud

A public cloud is owned by the cloud services provider (also known as a hosting provider). It provides
resources and services to multiple organizations and users, who connect to the cloud service via a secure
network connection, typically over the internet.

Public cloud models have the following characteristics:

● Ownership. This is the resources that an organization or end user uses. Examples include storage and
processing power. Resources do not belong to the organization that is utilizing them, but rather they
are owned and operated by a third party such as the cloud service provider.

● Multiple End Users. Public cloud modes may make their resources available to multiple organizations.

● Public Access. This provides access to the public.

● Availability. This is the most common cloud-type deployment model.

● Connectivity. Users and organizations are typically connected to the public cloud over the internet
using a web browser.

● Skills. Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to set up and use its resources.

With a public cloud, there is no local hardware to manage or keep up to date; everything runs on the
cloud provider’s hardware. In some cases, cloud users can save additional costs by sharing computing
resources with other cloud users.

A common use case scenario is deploying a web application or a blog site on hardware and resources
that are owned by a cloud provider. Using a public cloud in this scenario allows cloud users to get their
website or blog up quickly, and then focus on maintaining the site without having to worry about
purchasing, managing or maintaining the hardware on which it runs.

Businesses can use multiple public cloud service provider companies of varying scale. Microsoft Azure is
an example of a public cloud provider.
