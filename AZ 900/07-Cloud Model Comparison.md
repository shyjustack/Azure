## Cloud Model Comparison
### Public cloud
#### Advantages:

- No CapEx. You don’t have to buy a new server in order to scale.
- Agility. Applications can be made accessible quickly, and deprovisioned whenever needed.
- Consumption-based model. Organizations pay only for what they use, and operate under an
OpEx model.
- Maintenance. Organizations have no responsibility for hardware maintenance or updates.
- Skills. No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain the benefits of a public cloud.
Organizations can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure workloads are
secure, safe, and highly available.

#### Disadvantages:
- Security. There may be specific security requirements that cannot be met by using public cloud.
- Compliance. There may be government policies, industry standards, or legal requirements which
public clouds cannot meet.
- Ownership. Organizations don't own the hardware or services and cannot manage them as they
may wish.
- Specific scenarios. If organizations have a unique business requirement, such as having to
maintain a legacy application, it may be hard to meet that requirement with public cloud services.

### Private cloud
● Advantages:
● Control. Organizations have complete control over the resources.
● Security. Organizations have complete control over security.
● Compliance. If organizations have very strict security, compliance, or legal requirements, a private
cloud may be the only viable option.
● Specific scenarios. If an organization has a specific scenario not easily supported by a public
cloud provider (such as having to maintain a legacy application), it may be preferable to run the
application locally.
