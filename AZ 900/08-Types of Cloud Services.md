## Types of Cloud Services

### IaaS
IaaS is the most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure servers 
and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud provider on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.

IaaS has the following characteristics:

- Upfront costs. IaaS has no upfront costs. Users pay only for what they consume.
- User ownership. The user is responsible for the purchase, installation, configuration, and managment of their own software operating systems, middleware, and applications.
- Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for ensuring that the underlying cloud 
infrastructure (such as virtual machines, storage and networking) is available for the user.

#### Note: When using IaaS, ensuring that a service is up and running is a shared responsibility: the cloud 
provider is responsible for ensuring the cloud infrastructure is functioning correctly; the cloud customer is 
responsible for ensuring the service they are using is configured correctly, is up to date, and is available 
to their customers. This is referred to as the shared responsibility model.

Common usage scenarios:

- Migrating workloads. Typically, IaaS facilities are managed in a similar way as on-premises infrastructure, and provide an easy migration path for moving existing applications to the cloud.
- Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments, 
bringing new applications to market faster. IaaS makes scaling development testing environments up 
and down fast and economical
- Website hosting. Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than traditional web hosting.
- Storage, backup, and recovery. Organizations avoid the capital outlay and complexity of storage 
management, which typically requires a skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and compliance 
requirements. IaaS is useful for managing unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. 
It can also simplify the planning and management of backup and recovery systems.

### PaaS
PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of 
PaaS is to help create an application as quickly as possible without having to worry about managing the 
underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to 
install an operating system, web server, or even system updates. PaaS is a complete development and 
deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable organizations to deliver everything 
from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated cloud-enabled enterprise applications.

Resources are purchased from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and accessed over a 
secure Internet connection.

PaaS has the following characteristics:

- Upfront costs. There are no upfront costs, and users pay only for what they consume.
- User ownership. The user is responsible for the development of their own applications. However, 
they are not responsible for managing the server or infrastructure. This allows the user to focus on the 
application or workload they want to run.
- Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for operating system management, and 
network and service configuration. Cloud providers are typically responsible for everything apart from 
the application that a user wants to run. They provide a complete managed platform on which to run 
an application.

Common usage scenarios:

- Development framework. PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or 
customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create a Microsoft Excel macro, PaaS lets 
developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that 
developers must do.
- Analytics or business intelligence. Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to 
analyze and mine their data. They can find insights and patterns, and predict outcomes to improve 
business decisions such as forecasting, product design, and investment returns.

### SaaS
SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It allows users to connect to 
and use cloud-based apps over the internet. Common examples are email, calendars, and office tools 
such as Microsoft Office 365.
SaaS is typically licensed through a monthly or annual subscription, and Office 365 is an example of SaaS 
software.

SaaS has the following characteristics:

- Upfront costs. Users have no upfront costs; they pay a subscription, typically on a monthly or annual 
basis.
- User ownership. Users just use the application software; they are not responsible for any maintenance or management of that software.
- Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for the provision, management, and 
maintenance of the application software.
