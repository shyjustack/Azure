## Core Azure Architectural components

### Regions
Microsoft Azure is made up of datacenters located around the globe. These datacenters are organized 
and made available to end users by region.

A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters 
that are in close proximity and networked together with a low-latency network.
For most Azure services, when you deploy a resource in Azure, you choose the region where you want 
your resource to be deployed. A few examples of regions are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, 
Australia East, and Japan West

Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider. This provides customers the flexibility and 
scale needed to bring applications closer to users around the world, preserving data residency and 
offering comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customer. At the time of writing this, Azure 
is generally available in 70+ regions around the world 400+ Datacenters worldwide.
