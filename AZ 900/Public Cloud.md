### Public Cloud

A public cloud is owned by the cloud services provider (also known as a hosting provider). It provides
resources and services to multiple organizations and users, who connect to the cloud service via a secure
network connection, typically over the internet.

Public cloud models have the following characteristics:

● Ownership. This is the resources that an organization or end user uses. Examples include storage and
processing power. Resources do not belong to the organization that is utilizing them, but rather they
are owned and operated by a third party such as the cloud service provider.

● Multiple End Users. Public cloud modes may make their resources available to multiple organizations.

● Public Access. This provides access to the public.

● Availability. This is the most common cloud-type deployment model.

● Connectivity. Users and organizations are typically connected to the public cloud over the internet
using a web browser.

● Skills. Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to set up and use its resources.
