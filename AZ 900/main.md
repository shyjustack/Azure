### What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change. 

Cloud services is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Cloud services have particular characteristics and considerations, some of which are outlined and explained below:

● High availability. The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime, depending on the service in question. 

● Scalability. The ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload. You can add additional resources to service a workload (known as scaling out), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in demand to the existing resource (known as scaling up). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically 

● Elasticity. The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed. Elastic resources match the current needs, and resources are added or removed automatically to meet future needs when it’s needed, and from the most advantageous geographic location. A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically 

● Agility. The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. They are provided on-demand via self-service, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. There is no manual intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services.
