### What is a Storage Account?
Azure storage accounts provides storage services and a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.
An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects, including:
• blobs
• file shares
