### What is a Storage Account?
Azure storage accounts provides storage services and a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.

An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects, including:
- blobs
- file shares
- queues
- tables

### Storage Account Names
Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.

Your storage account name must be unique within Azure. No two storage accounts can have the same name.
