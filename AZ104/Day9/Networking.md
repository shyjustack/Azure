### Hub-and-spoke topology
A hub-and-spoke topology defines connectivity between a selected hub virtual network and spoke virtual networks that are members of one or more selected spoke network groups. The hub virtual network gets bi-directionally peered with every spoke network group's virtual network members in the configuration. This topology is useful for isolating a virtual network but still maintaining connectivity to common resources in the hub virtual network.
