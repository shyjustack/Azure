### SonarQube

SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It helps developers and teams identify and fix issues in their code by performing static code analysis. Here’s what it does:

Key Features

- Code Quality Analysis: Detects bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
- Supports Multiple Languages: Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and many more.
- Security Checks: Identifies security hotspots and potential vulnerabilities.
- Maintainability Metrics: Measures code complexity, duplication, and test coverage.
- Integration: Works with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, etc.).

How It Works

- You install SonarQube on a server or use SonarCloud (cloud version).
- Developers run a scanner during builds to analyze the code.
- Results are sent to the SonarQube dashboard, where you can review issues and trends.

Why Use It?

- Improves code quality and security.
- Helps enforce coding standards.
- Provides actionable insights for refactoring.
