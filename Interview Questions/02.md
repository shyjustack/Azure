### Q2: What is the difference between VM deallocate, stop, and delete?
**A:**  
- **Stop (deallocated)**: VM is shut down and billing stops.  
- **Stop** (without deallocate via OS): VM is off, but you're still billed.  
- **Delete**: VM is removed; associated resources may remain.

### Q3: What is an Availability Set?
**A:**  
An Availability Set ensures high availability of VMs by spreading them across **fault domains** (hardware isolation) and **update domains** (software patching isolation).

---

### Q4: What is a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)?
**A:**  
VMSS is an Azure compute resource that allows you to deploy and manage a set of identical, autoscaling VMs with load balancing and high availability.

---

### Q5: What are fault domains and update domains?
**A:**  
- **Fault Domain**: A group of VMs that share the same power and network source.  
- **Update Domain**: A group of VMs updated together during maintenance.

### Q6: How can you resize an Azure VM?
**A:**  
1. Stop (deallocate) the VM  
2. Go to VM > "Size"  
3. Choose a new size compatible with the region and hardware  
4. Apply and restart the VM

### Q7: What is Azure Dedicated Host?
**A:**  
An Azure Dedicated Host provides a physical server dedicated to your VMs, allowing for host-level isolation and compliance needs.

---

### Q8: What are the types of disks in Azure VMs?
**A:**  
- **OS Disk**: Required for booting the VM  
- **Data Disk**: Optional additional storage  
- **Temporary Disk**: Non-persistent, used for pagefile (D:\ drive in Windows)

---

### Q9: What is the difference between managed and unmanaged disks?
**A:**  
- **Managed Disks**: Azure handles storage accounts, more scalable and secure  
- **Unmanaged Disks**: User-managed storage accounts, less recommended now

---

### Q10: How does Azure support VM backup?
**A:**  
Azure Backup service integrates with Recovery Services vault to schedule and manage VM backups with restore points and retention policies.

---

### Q11: How do you automate VM deployments?
**A:**  
Using:
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates  
- Bicep templates  
- PowerShell/Azure CLI scripts  
- Terraform (for IaC)

---

### Q12: How does Azure Spot VM pricing work?
**A:**  
Spot VMs let you use unused Azure capacity at discounted rates. They can be evicted when Azure needs resources or the price exceeds your set max.

---

### Q13: What are Extensions in Azure VMs?
**A:**  
Extensions are small apps that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks (e.g., installing antivirus, running scripts).

---

### Q14: Whatâ€™s the difference between Gen1 and Gen2 Azure VMs?
**A:**  
- **Gen1**: Uses BIOS-based boot and legacy architecture  
- **Gen2**: Uses UEFI-based boot, supports larger disks, and enhanced features

---

### Q15: What tools can be used to connect to a Windows or Linux VM?
**A:**  
- **Windows VM**: RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)  
- **Linux VM**: SSH (Secure Shell)
